This is my Website Design for Cumberland Valley Regional Student Convention and possibly International Student Convention in 2022.

This website is open-source. There is a mirror on GitHub at https://github.com/daviddgtnt/websitedesign2022. If you are on GitHub and want to find the main repo, look at https://daviddgtntshouse.tk/cgit/websitedesign2022. Issues and pull requests on the GitHub repo are not accepted due to this being a school project.
