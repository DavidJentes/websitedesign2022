This is my Website Design for Cumberland Valley Regional Student Convention and possibly International Student Convention in 2022.

This website is open-source. There is a mirror on GitHub at [https://github.com/daviddgtnt/websitedesign2022](https://github.com/daviddgtnt/websitedesign2022). If you are on GitHub and want to find the main repo, look at [https://daviddgtntshouse.tk/cgit/websitedesign2022](https://daviddgtntshouse.tk/cgit/websitedesign2022). Issues and pull requests on the GitHub repo are not accepted due to this being a school project.

Previous Website Design project that was originally going to be shown at Cumberland Valley Junior Student convention:

Note: I'm all for free and open-source, but since this is a school project, I added a DOCX version too because I needed to for school.
