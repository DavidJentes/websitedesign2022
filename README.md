This is my Website Design for Cumberland Valley Regional Student Convention and International Student Convention in 2022.

This website is open-source. There is a mirror on GitHub at [https://github.com/DavidJentes/websitedesign2022](https://github.com/DavidJentes/websitedesign2022). If you are on GitHub and want to find the main repo, look at [https://git.daviddgtnt.xyz/davidjentes/websitedesign2022](https://git.daviddgtnt.xyz/davidjentes/websitedesign2022). Issues and pull requests on the GitHub repo are not accepted due to this being a school project.
