Dear judges,<br><br>
This has not been fully set up for the reasoning that these books have not actually been printed, let alone written, and it would take extra work to set up a system to handle the orders. If this was an actual website, I would use the Stripe API (application programming interface) to make the store. I have already done this before, outside of convention or school projects.<br><br>
