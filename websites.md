The server these are hosted on runs Ubuntu 20.04 and is a VM running under Proxmox Virtual Environment, based on Debian 11 Bullseye.

All of these programs are web-based, which means they can all be accessed over the internet and accessed through Google Chrome or another web browser.

All other software involved is running on my server through either Guacamole or code-server and most is free and open source. Anything that runs on my server cannot and will not affect any network other than my own.
