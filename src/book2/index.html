                    <p>Hey! Why's there water on my back?  </p>

                    <p>In Lyza the Sheepdog: The Flood, Lyza talks to the animals that were at going to the Ark before the flood. She hears what others are thinking about what's going on, and tries to figure out whats going on herself.  </p>

                    <p>When you read this book, you enter the world of Lyza the Sheepdog, a world where the event of Jesus' birth and all things that came before are the same, and we can see the fictional responses of the animals.  </p>

                    <p>This book was released in December of 2021.</p>
