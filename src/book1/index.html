            <p>Hey look, a baby has been born! Wait, what is that star?  </p>

            <p>In Lyza the Sheepdog: Christmas, Lyza talks to the animals that were at the stable at Jesus' birth. She hears what others are thinking about what's going on, and tries to figure out whats going on herself.  </p>

            <p>When you read this book, you enter the world of Lyza the Sheepdog, a world where the event of Jesus' birth and all things that came before are the same, and we can see the fictional responses of the animals.  </p>

            <p>This book was released in December of 2020.</p>
